ServoController

In this assignment the task was to create IP core for controlling multiple channels of servo motors. In this report the design process and testing will be described and discussed. Different modules will be explained and why the code was designed like this. 

In this design task there was 3 different prerequisites. These prerequisites where as follows; Create a module to control servo channels, be able to change the design for multiple different clock speeds using a frequency divider, instantiate multiple channels of controllers. The design must also be tested using both software simulation and hardware testing. The servo controllers PWM Signal must total time run for 20ms but the on period was around must be between 0.5ms (for -90 degree angle) to 2.5ms (for +90 degree angle).
